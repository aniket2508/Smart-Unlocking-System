# Smart-Unlocking-System

We propose a model for face detection and recognition which allows real time addition of new
faces to the database in seconds, without retraining an entire neural network. We utilize existing
State of the Art Facial Recognition models for facial feature extraction and utilize it to create a
smart contactless unlocking system.
The system provides secure door locks for homes or other locations that can be
accessed by registered users once their face is recognized by the system, using machine
learning techniques. This system provides automation as many users can be registered with the
system or removed from it by using the system UI.
One of the main features is Anti-spoof detection (Liveness Detection). This Anti-spoof
detection is very accurate and cost effective. If any intruder is detected, their photograph is
stored for future use.
